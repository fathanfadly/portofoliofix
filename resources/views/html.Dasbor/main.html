            <h3>C</h3>
            <p>
              C is a procedural programming language. It was initially developed by Dennis Ritchie as a system programming language to write operating systems. C is a general-purpose programming language that is extremely popular, simple, and flexible to use. It is a structured programming language that is machine-independent and extensively used to write various applications, operating systems like Windows, and many other complex programs2.

            <h3>Python</h3>
            <p>
              Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together.

            <h3>C++</h3>  
            <p>
              C++ is a cross-platform programming language that can be used to create high-performance applications. It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension to the C language. C++ is regarded as a middle-level language, as it comprises a combination of both high-level and low-level language features. It is often viewed as a superset of C. C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.

           <p>
            is a programming language by Microsoft. C# combines the computational power of C++ and the ease of Visual Basic, Microsoft’s event-driven programming language and environment. C# gets its foundation from C++, has features similar to Java and applications across many areas in software development. There’s a high demand for C# developers in the job market.

            <p>
              is a form of programming code used to instruct a browser to create the structure for individual web pages on a website. This markup language is a fundamental component of how billions of people perceive and consume pages on the internet. HTML is responsible for things like text representation, defining visual format, providing search engines with page context and designating sections of a page.

            <h3>Java</h3>   
            <p>Java is a widely-used, high-level programming language known for its platform independence, versatility, and robustness. Developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle Corporation) in the mid-1990s, Java was designed with the principle of "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that Java programs can run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed, without needing to be recompiled. This platform independence is achieved through Java's bytecode, which is an intermediate representation of the program that can be executed on any device with a JVM.</p>
